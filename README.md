See requirements.org (plain-text) for a description of the project.

Make a shared state AJAX drawing program.

Drawing on the canvas results in digits of pi being drawn, one by one, up to one thousand digits. It then wraps back around to the first digit of pi.

Collaboration
=============================

I discussed how to approach the assignment and any issues I ran into together with Vinny Luu. I helped Hongfang Xu by clarifying some confusions he had regarding the assignment and its requirements.
